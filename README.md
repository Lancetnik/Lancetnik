### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm @Lancetnik (Pastukhov Nikita)

I'm a fullstack developer living and working in Russia. :ru:

I have been building APIs and tools for Machine Learning and data systems, with different teams and organizations. ðŸŒŽ

I created [**Propan**](https://lancetnik.github.io/Propan/)ðŸš€ and currently spend a huge part of my time to work on it. ðŸ¤“
